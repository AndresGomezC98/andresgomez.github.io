# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Andres Gomez  
### Data Analyst in training | Aspiring Data Engineer  

Welcome to my portfolio! ðŸŽ¯  
Here I share real-world projects where I use **SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python** to analyze and visualize data, extract business insights, and design solutions that support decision-making.  

My long-term goal is to transition into **Data Engineering**, where I can design robust data pipelines and architectures to power analytics and machine learning.
